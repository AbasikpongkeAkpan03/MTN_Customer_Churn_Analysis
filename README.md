## INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS 

### DASHBOARD 1 
#### 1. Number of Customers by MTN Devices Purchased:
- "Mobile SIM Card" has the highest number of customers (296). This is expected as most users would have a SIM card.
- "5G Broadband Router" and "Broadband Mifi" have a substantial number of customers (229 and 216 respectively), indicating a strong uptake of dedicated broadband solutions.
- "4G Router" has fewer customers.

#### 2.Number of Customers by Bottom 5 States:
Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Kano, Rivers, Lagos, Ondo, and Kaduna are listed as bottom 5 states (though more than 5 are shown). The number of customers in these states is relatively low (between 8 and 10), consistent with their lower revenue generation.

#### 3. Number of Customers by Top 5 States:
Bauchi, Kogi, Osun, Abia, and Borno are the top 5 states by customer count, with 20 customers each in Bauchi, Kogi, and Osun, and 18 in Abia and Borno. This aligns with the top revenue-generating states.

#### 4. Number of Customers by Age Brackets:
"Middle Adult" (163 customers) and "Adult" (133 customers) represent the largest customer segments, mirroring their revenue contribution.
"Senior Adult," "Old Adult," "Young Adult," and "Teenager" have progressively fewer customers.

#### 5. Number of Customers by Top 10 Subscription Plans:
- "60GB Monthly Broadband Plan" has the highest number of customers (79).
- "150GB FUP Monthly Unlimited" (75) and "165GB Monthly Plan" (73) also have a significant number of customers.
- These findings align with the top revenue-generating plans, indicating popular and frequently purchased options.

### DASHBOARD 2
#### 1. Revenue Generated by MTN Devices Purchased:
- "5G Broadband" is by far the highest revenue generator (over 100M).
- "Broadband Mifi" is next (around 50M).
- "4G Router" and "Mobile SIM Card" generate significantly less revenue. This highlights the substantial revenue contribution from dedicated broadband devices.

#### 2. Top 5 Revenue Generating States:
- Osun, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Kogi, and Bauchi are the top 5 revenue-generating states. Osun leads with over 8M.

#### 3. Bottom 5 Revenue Generating States:
- Bayelsa, Delta, Kano, Rivers, and Lagos are the bottom 5 revenue-generating states. Lagos is surprisingly low with around 2M, which could indicate a smaller customer base for broadband or different usage patterns in the analyzed segment.

#### 4. Revenue Generated by Age Brackets:
- "Middle Adult" and "Adult" age brackets generate the most revenue (around 70M and 57M, respectively).
- "Senior Adult" and "Old Adult" also contribute significantly.
- "Young Adult" and "Teenager" contribute the least. This indicates that the core revenue comes from the middle-aged and older adult segments.

#### 5. Top 10 Revenue Generating Subscription Plans:
- "150GB FUP Monthly Plan" is the highest revenue generator (over 20M).
- "150GB FUP Monthly Unlimited" and "100GB FUP Monthly Unlimited" are also major contributors.
- Higher data volume broadband plans are clearly the top revenue drivers.

#### 6. Average Number of Times Purchased by Subscription Plan:
- Plans like "120GB Monthly Unlimited" (12.75 times), "30GB Monthly" (11.93 times), "20GB Monthly" (11.66 times), and "60GB Monthly" (11.53 times) are purchased most frequently. This suggests customers are regularly subscribing to these plans.
- Conversely, plans like "300GB Monthly" and "200GB Monthly" (at the right end, around 9.5 times) are purchased less frequently, possibly due to their higher price point or niche usage.

### DASHBOARD 3
#### 1. Customer Review Distribution:
- A significant number of customers provide "Very Good" and "Good" reviews, suggesting general satisfaction. There are fewer "Fair" and "Bad" reviews.

#### 2. Average Data Usage by Customer Review: Customers who give "Very Good" and "Good" reviews tend to have higher average data usage compared to those who give "Fair" or "Bad" reviews. - - This suggests a correlation between satisfaction and data consumption. Higher data consumption might indicate more engagement and satisfaction.

#### 3. Average Data Usage by MTN Device:
- "5G Router" shows the highest average data usage (26.1%).
- "Broadband Mifi" is also high (25.58%).
- "Mobile SIM Card" and "4G Router" show lower average data usage. This indicates that customers using dedicated broadband devices consume significantly more data.

#### 4. Average Satisfaction Rate by MTN Device:
- "Broadband Mifi" users have the highest satisfaction rate (around 3.8).
- "5G Broadband" users also show high satisfaction (around 3.7).
- "Mobile SIM Card" and "4G Router" have lower satisfaction rates. This aligns with the data usage finding â€“ higher data consumption via dedicated devices seems to correlate with higher satisfaction.
- Average Customer Tenure by Customer Review: Customers giving "Very Good" and "Good" reviews tend to have longer average tenures (around 30 months) compared to those giving "Fair" or - - "Bad" reviews (around 28 months). This suggests that satisfied customers stay longer.

#### 6. Average Satisfaction Rate by Subscription Plan:
- There's a wide range of satisfaction across different subscription plans.
- Plans like "20GB 1-Month Daily Plan" (Highest at 3.8) and "30GB Monthly Broadband Plan" show higher satisfaction.
- Plans like "10GB + 10 Mins Monthly Plan," "10GB Monthly Unlimited," "12.5GB Monthly Plan," "1.5GB 1-Day Plan," and "30GB Monthly" (the ones towards the right with lower bars) have notably lower satisfaction rates (below 2.5). This is a critical finding, as certain plans are clearly underperforming in terms of customer satisfaction.

### DASHBOARD 4
#### 1. Overall Churn Status:
- Out of a total of 496 customers analyzed, 146 customers (29.4%) have churned, while 350 customers (70.6%) have not. This indicates a significant churn rate that needs addressing.

#### 2. Customer Gender Distribution:
- The customer base is almost evenly split between genders: 246 females (49.6%) and 250 males (50.4%). Churn doesn't appear to be disproportionately linked to one gender over the other based on this high-level view.

#### 3. Churn by Reasons:
- Better Offers from Competitors (29 customers): This is the leading cause of churn, highlighting strong competition in the market.
- High Call Tariffs (26 customers): Pricing for calls is a significant factor in customers leaving.
- Costly Data Plans (20 customers): Data plan pricing is another major contributor to churn.
- Poor Network (20 customers): Network quality issues are driving customers away.
- Fast Data Consumption (18 customers): Customers are dissatisfied with how quickly their data is used up.
- Poor Customer Service (18 customers): Issues with customer support are contributing to churn.
- Relocation (15 customers): While a factor, relocation is less controllable by MTN compared to other reasons.

#### 4. Monthly Trends (Based on the buttons, but no data shown for February/March):
-The dashboard allows for filtering by months (February, January, March). 
Geographical Distribution (States):
- The dashboard includes a list of states; this filter would enable identification of regional churn hotspots.


### RECOMMENDATIONS
#### 1. Value-Centric Product & Pricing Strategy:
Proactively address competitive pricing and perceived value gaps, which are the leading causes of churn. This isn't just about being cheaper, but about offering more perceived value for money across all segments.
##### Actionable steps:
- Dynamic Pricing Models: Implement flexible and competitive pricing for both voice and data, particularly for mobile SIM card users. Consider tiered data plans, usage-based discounts, or family bundles that offer superior value compared to competitors.
- Targeted Loyalty Offers: Develop and implement robust loyalty programs that reward long-term customers and offer personalized deals (e.g., bonus data, discounts on upgrades, exclusive content) to prevent them from seeking competitor offers.
- Bundling & Upselling: Create attractive bundles that combine high-satisfaction services (e.g., dedicated broadband devices with high-volume data plans) with voice services to increase overall customer value and stickiness.
- Address Plan-Specific Dissatisfaction: Systematically review and revise subscription plans identified with low satisfaction. This may involve increasing data allowances, reducing prices, or bundling value-added services.

#### 2. Uncompromising Network Quality & Performance:
Given "poor network" and "fast data consumption" as significant churn drivers, continuous investment in and optimization of network infrastructure are paramount.
##### Actionable Steps:
- Network Expansion & Optimization: Prioritize investments in expanding 5G and broadband network coverage and capacity, especially in areas with high churn or high customer density.
Data Consumption Transparency: Provide customers with intuitive tools and regular notifications to monitor their data consumption and avoid bill shock or unexpected depletion. Consider data rollover features.
- Proactive Maintenance: Implement robust network monitoring and predictive maintenance to minimize downtime and ensure consistent service quality. Communicate service improvements transparently.

#### 3.Exceptional Customer Experience & Service:
Address "poor customer service" by empowering frontline staff and leveraging technology to provide seamless and effective support.
##### Actionable Steps:
- Training & Empowerment: Provide extensive training to customer service representatives, focusing on empathy, problem-solving, and first-call resolution. Empower them to make immediate decisions to resolve common customer issues.
- Multi-Channel Support: Enhance digital self-service options (e.g., user-friendly mobile apps, comprehensive FAQs, AI-powered chatbots) to reduce reliance on traditional call centres and improve accessibility.
- Feedback Loops: Establish strong feedback mechanisms to capture customer sentiment (e.g., post-interaction surveys) and use these insights to continuously improve service processes.

#### 4. Data-Driven Customer Segmentation & Engagement:
Leverage the rich data from the dashboards to understand different customer segments and tailor engagement strategies to their specific needs and churn risks.
##### Actionable Steps:
- Churn Prediction Model: Develop and refine a predictive analytics model to identify customers at high risk of churning based on their usage patterns, satisfaction scores, complaint history, and tenure.
- Segment-Specific Marketing: Tailor marketing messages and product offerings to different age brackets and geographical regions, focusing on the specific value propositions most relevant to them. For instance, market broadband solutions to middle and older adults, and value-packed mobile SIM plans to younger adults.
- Regional Focus: Conduct deeper localized analysis for top and bottom-performing states to understand unique challenges or opportunities. Allocate resources (e.g., network upgrades, promotional activities) strategically to address regional disparities and maximise retention in vulnerable areas.

#### 5. Continuous Monitoring & Adaptability:
Churn analysis should be an ongoing process, not a one-time exercise. Regularly monitor key performance indicators and adapt strategies based on evolving market conditions and customer feedback.
##### Actionable Steps:
- Dashboard Utilization: Make these churn analysis dashboards (and potentially more granular versions) a standard part of weekly/monthly management reviews.
- A/B Testing: Continuously test different pricing models, promotional offers, and customer service approaches to identify what works best in reducing churn.
- Competitor Intelligence: Maintain a robust competitor intelligence gathering system to stay ahead of market changes and react swiftly to new offers or service innovations.

By implementing these recommendations, MTN can create a more resilient customer base, foster greater loyalty, and significantly trim down its churn rate across all customer segments and service offerings.
